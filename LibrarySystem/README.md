**Library System**

I added the explanation within the codes as comments. Therefore, I will elaborate the outputs here.

**Screenshots of the outputs**

Firstly, it displays the library system menu, offering 4 options to the users.

As you may see, I chose option 1, which is to add the book into the system. For that, I pressed 1 and entered. Then, it prompted me to enter the book title which I gave as “Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban”. Then, the program proceeds to prompt the user another question, regarding the name of the author, in which I filled as “J.K.Rowling”. Consequently, right after that it asked me how many quantites of that book I wanted to add. So I added 10 books into the system. After all the valid inputs, the program printed out a message that indicates that I hav successfully added a new book into the system.

Same scenario, just the different function, here. But one notable thing is that, in here, I typed the title of the book in the lowercase letters, or vice versa, any how the program will understood and still returned intended result. So that was my little modification. Finally, it informed that the process is successful by stating it so.

Just as previous ones, this is the function for returning the books.

Lastly, choosing option 4 will exit the system.

**_Invalid input and Error messages_**

Including a period after the number will result in an error message and the program will inform you by stating it so.

However, you are still allow to recorrect and type the number you intend to pick. And it will functions as the same as before.

If the title is wrongly typed, or misspelled, the book will not be detected by the system.

Likewise, even if the title was right, but the quantities of book you borrow is larger than they have, it will inform you by stating it so, like in the photo.
If both were wrong, it will display as in the following:

For returning book, it doesn’t necessarily gives out invalid messages. Only misspelled or wrong the book title could gives out one.
As for the exit, it just quitting from the program. Therefore, the displays no error messages.
